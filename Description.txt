University project - Data Structures and Algorithms
Graph Representation and Graph Traversal - Delivery Route Optimisation
We were asked to use Breadth First Search or Depth First Search for graph traversals.
Other algorithms were not part of the original project but I will be adding other algorithms that could find the shortest path
for graph traversals.

The project invovles:
Setting up default graph - a graph representation of a default graph that contains named locations/node that are already connected with 
each other.

Adding New Locations - Functionality to add new locations into the default graoh and connecting them to existing nodes
Deleting Routes - Removing the edges that connec the 2 nodes to eliminate a route in the graph represenation
Adding new Route - Adding routes between 2 different nodes.
Deleting Locations - Functionality to remove an existing location/ node in the matrix
